# Localization for translators

## Organisation

We are looking for one team lead per language, please. If you want to share the work in a team, that's fine, but **each language team needs to agree upon one person who will lead it and adjudicate any differences of opinion that may arise**.

Anyone interested in translating, please create an account at https://www.oneskyapp.com/ and then PM me your username and the language(s) you support, via GitHub, Discord or OneSky. My username on OneSky is `VerticalBlank`.

The translation project itself is located at https://osxtyfi.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=145348.

## Notes

- **NATIVE SPEAKERS ONLY PLEASE!** Goes without saying.
- Text that appears in the UI must be perfect. Text that is only spoken can be a bit more lax.
- Please try to keep any text in the UI as brief as possible, to minimize cognitive burden.
